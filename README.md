# React Native Intermittent Crash on iOS Data Fetch

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in a React Native application where an intermittent crash occurs on iOS devices specifically when fetching data from a remote API. The crash is inconsistent and difficult to reproduce reliably. This makes debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

A React Native application intermittently crashes on iOS devices during API data fetching.  Error logs are inconsistent and don't provide a clear root cause.  The crash appears random and isn't tied to specific network conditions or data payload sizes. 

## Solution

The solution involves using a more robust error-handling mechanism and potentially implementing exponential backoff strategies to retry failed API requests.

## How to Reproduce (if possible)

*Not consistently reproducible but can be attempted by repeatedly fetching data*. 

## Technologies Used

* React Native
* JavaScript
